## Information We Collect
We collect your email address when you create an account or sign in to the App. This information is used to create and maintain your account and display your identity within the App. If you choose to sign in using your Apple, Google, or Microsoft account, your email address is shared with us through these authentication services. These platforms may also collect and use your data in line with their own privacy policies: [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), and [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

If you choose to request a free WiLO Tag through the App, we collect your email address to process and fulfill your request. If you subscribe to email updates while making this request, we will use your email address to send you email updates.

We may collect warehouse names you create through the App to display warehouse overviews with critical monitoring data. These overviews include information such as detected leaks, temperature and humidity readings retrieved from your existing WiLO sensors and tags that collect data with your consent.

To enable monitoring and tracking of your previously purchased WiLO sensors/tags, we collect device status information. We may also collect location coordinates for your sensors/tags if you choose to provide them. This location information is used for rendering the services (such as building 3D plots of your warehouse) you may have requested and consented to when purchasing WiLO sensors and tags.

To maintain authentication and provide optimal performance, the App temporarily stores authentication tokens and your email address securely on your device by encrypting them. This information is automatically cleared and removed from your device when you log out.

## Data Storage and Security
We take your privacy and data security seriously. Your login credentials are managed through Microsoft Entra ID, an enterprise-grade identity service that provides secure authentication. Any information collected from the app about your warehouses, and sensors/tags is stored securely on our servers with encryption both in transit using HTTPS and at rest. Access to your data is restricted to you.

For a seamless experience, authentication details are stored securely on your device using encrypted storage and are automatically deleted when you log out of the app. All other information we collect is securely stored on our servers for as long as needed to provide the core functioanlity of the app.

## Data Usage
We use the information we collect to verify your identity, provide core features of the App, and display relevant account information such as warehouse and device details. Your email address is used to display your identity within the App, process and confirm your request for a free WiLO Tag if applicable, and send marketing communications only if you have chosen to subscribe. You can unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time using the link provided in each message.

We do not use your personal data for any other purposes, such as analytics or advertising.
